To use labcontrol with Apache2, you have to do a bit of setup.

You need to:
 - install Apache and make sure it's running
 - install the lcserver.py script in a location where Apache can run it
 - configure the url_base and files_url_base in your /etc/lcserver.conf file
 - make sure that Apache passes authorization information
   (so user can log in via lc)

I got a lot of great info from:
 - Enabling Apache2 on Ubuntu 20.04:
   - https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-the-apache-web-server-on-ubuntu-20-04
and
 - Enabling cgi scripts on Apache 2:
   - https://www.server-world.info/en/note?os=Ubuntu_20.04&p=httpd&f=5


Here's how I configured things:
 - cp /home/tbird/work/labcontrol/lcserver.conf /etc/lcserver.conf
   - edit to customize for your lab
     - lab_name, admin_contact_str, and base_url

 - $ sudo ln -s /home/tbird/work/labcontrol/lcserver.py /usr/lib/cgi-bin/lcserver.py
 - $ a2enmod cgid
   - this enables /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/serve-cgi-bin.conf

 - $ sudo ln -s /home/tbird/work/labcontrol/lc-data /var/www/html/lc-data
   - this makes the direct-files link for serving raw json files

 - $ vi /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/serve-cgi-bin.conf
   - add the following line in the section <Directory "/usr/bin/cgi-bin">
      CGIPassAuth On

 - $ systemctl reload apache
   - reload the configuration
